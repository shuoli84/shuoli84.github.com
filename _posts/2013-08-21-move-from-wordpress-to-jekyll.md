Previously I set up one wordpress in my aliyun server, the installation experience was a pleasure, and for first couple of days, everything worked fine. From one day, suddenly I experienced mysql outage, checked the error log, it indicates the cause is memory shortage. I am not an expert on mysql neither want to be, so I decide to move out.

After googleing, I decide to give jekyll a try. It has several advantages:
 1. No server needed! You can use github pages to host it. That means no money, no maintainance, no headaches. It is perfect for a small blog site.
 2. It is simple. I can get familiar with it within hours, requires no knowledge on Database etc. Just a static web site with some ruby code.
 3. It is hot. 

I won't bother to create another installation guide, just some references: 
 * [jekyllboostrap.com](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)
 * [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com)

Google "install jekyll".

Enjoy~
